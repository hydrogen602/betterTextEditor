# betterTextEditor
A text editor for that has python synthax highlighting unlike nano and is easy to exit unlike vim

After getting annoyed at the text editors available like nano and vim, I've decided to make my own text editor
that is both easy to use and does synthax highlighing whenever I need to edit python files over ssh like
when using a raspberry pi.

## TODO
* Syntax highlighting for other languages like html, css, & js
* ability to change name after opening the file like in nano?
* key-combo to exit on windows (there's no option key)
